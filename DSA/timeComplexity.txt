Time Complexity:
    Time taken bu an algorithm as a functio of the length of input.
"O()" will be used to represent the times highest order in the time equation.
    lets say,
        sum of numbers:
            1. using the formula --> this will take very less time. it's in O(1)
            2. using the any loop --> this will take time and lets say we have N numbers to sum. Then the O(n) will be the time complexity.

Recursion Time Complexity will be a bit tuffer than normal loops (It may be bit tuffer not tuffest thing to do!)

We can use recursion tree or expansion substition methods to find out the time complexity of the program.

For Example:
    t(n)= 2t(n/2)+c
    t(n/2)= 2t(n/4)+c
    t(n/4)= 2t(n/8)+c
    :
    :
    :
    t(1)=1;

    => t(n)= 2^n-1(t1)+(2^n-1)c
