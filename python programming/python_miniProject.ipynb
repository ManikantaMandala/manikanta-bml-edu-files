    "# Python Mini Project:\n",
    "    * Topic: Cows and Bulls(A two player game).\n",
    "    * In this game, a player tries to guess a 4 digit code number chosen by the second player.\n",
    "    * For that there are some rules and hints:\n",
    "        * A player will creates a secrete code of 4-digit number. This number should have no repeated digits and no zero.\n",
    "        * Another player makes a guess to guess the secrete number.(There will be 2 hints(Cows and Bulls)).\n",
    "        * Bulls indicate the number of \"correct digits\" in the \"correct position\" and Cows indicates the number of \"correct digits\" in the \"wrong position\". For example, if the 4-digit code is *3245* and the guessed number is *1234* then we have 1 Bull(2 is in correct position and correct digit) and 2 Cows( 3,4 are correct digits but they are in wrong position).\n",
    "        * The player keeps on guessing until the secrete code is cracked. The player who guesses in the minimum number of tries wins."
