    <h2 style="text-align: center;color: cornflowerblue;width: 25mm;">Goa</h1>
    <p>The state of Goa, in India, is famous for its beaches and places of worship. Tourism is its primary industry, and is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist activity inland.
        Foreign tourists, mostly from Europe, arrive in Goa in winter, whilst the summer and monsoon seasons see many Indian tourists. Goa handled 2.29% of all foreign tourist arrivals in the country in 2011. <br>
        This relatively small state is situated on the west coast of India, between the borders of Maharashtra and Karnataka, and is better known to the world as a former Portuguese enclave on Indian soil. <br>
        Thus, Tourism forms the backbone of Goa's economy.
        Major tourist attractions include Bom Jesus Basilica, Fort Aguada, a wax museum on Indian culture, and a heritage museum. The Churches and Convents of Goa have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. <br>
        As of 2013, Goa was the destination of choice for Indian and foreign tourists, particularly Britons, with limited means who wanted to party. The state was hopeful that changes could be made which would attract a <br>
        more upscale demographic.
        On 24 November 2017, Delta Corp Limited claimed to have set up the first casino game training course centre in India at Goa.</p>

    <pre>Review2:
        When one hears the name Goa, the first thing that pops up in the mind are blue blue seas and swaying coconut palms on pristine beaches. The imagination is not really far from reality. 
        Goa is all this and much more than Beach, Babes and Beer. The culture, the rich Portuguese heritage, worn with more than a grain of pride on the collars by the Goans reflects the inclusivity and 
        the open ness of the people of this amazing coastal state to embrace different cultures and merge it with their own. The people of Goa are proud of their culture, their heritage and their state.
        They have an opinion on everything, whether it is weather, politics, tourism and the poison a.k.a drugs. They do not shy away from speaking their minds. The cuisine, well words can't explain the 
        mouth watering, delicious, scrumptious and wide variety of the Goan cuisine, which majorly comprises of Non vegetarian staples. The breads, especially the poie, never found such delicious,
        wood fired bread outside of the state. The vibrant and colorful houses that dot the narrow lanes and the swaying palms that dot many a winding road bring a kind of much needed calm 
        and peace to the overtaxed mind and soul, is beyond words.Unfortunately, most of the visitors to this seaside state, only visit for the cheap alcohol and to drool at the bikini clad athithis 
        from saat samundar paar.I say, get off the blinkers of such vulgarity and explore this beautiful state and you just might find some hidden gems of nature, hidden to be found by true treasure hunters.</pre>
