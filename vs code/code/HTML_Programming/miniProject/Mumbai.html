    <p>Located on Maharashtra’s coast, Mumbai is India’s most-populous city, and it is one of the largest and most densely populated urban areas in the world. It was built on <br>
       a site of ancient settlement, and it took its name from the local goddess Mumba—a form of Parvati, the consort of Shiva, one of the principal deities of Hinduism—whose <br>
       temple once stood in what is now the southeastern section of the city. It became known as Bombay during the British colonial period, the name possibly an Anglicized <br> 
       corruption of Mumbai or perhaps of Bom Baim (“Good Harbour”), supposedly a Portuguese name for the locale. The name Mumbai was restored officially in 1995, although Bombay <br> 
       remained in common usage.</p>
    <h3>Review of Mumbai</h3>
    <p>Review1: <br>
        Mumbai is worst city i have seen in my life, roads are filled with beggar people have no seance of traffic and police man never support, I was surprised when they say why you come here,<br>
        I never suggest anyone to visit INDIA if you love for your life and wife.

    <p>Review2: <br>
        Mumbai the city is an experience everyone should endure. Exhausted after the flight the cab ride was "interesting". The cabbie drove us about 2-miles from the airport and wanted more money,<br>
        saying he needed gas money! Fortunately I was with a friend that grew up there that suggested he drive on before we have an issue. <br>
        The smells, sights and sounds were amazing, Nothing like I have ever experienced growing up in the states. I truly feel the majority of our troubled teens should be made to lived there for at <br>
        least 30-days to show them how fortunate they are.
        I being the more adventurous type had a good time, but again I was with a local who gave me the grade-A tour. We visited many shops, museums and islands dedicated to one god or the other. <br>
        Bombay was a good experience and I did enjoy most of it. The extreme poverty is a bit depressing though, and I have a ne appreciation for many things.
