-----------------------POINTERS--------------------------------(#==points;@==questions)
#pointers(defination): variable that stores the address of the another variable of same type.
#declaration(syntax): data_type * variable_name; -----> this means 
	"the VALUE AT is variable_name has a ADDRESS of a int variable."  //for declaration.
@What happens when we you a point like a normal variable?

Eg:
	int a,*p;
	p=&a; 
	a=5;
	p=204; //lets the address of a is 204 and the address of p is 64
	printf("%d %d %d %d %d",p,&a,&p,*p); //204 204 64 5
	*p=8;
	printf("%d",a); //8 
//printing the value of a variable with a pointer is called derefrencing

WORKING WITH POINTERS:
storage classes in c programming:
Problems1:
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
	int a;
	int *p;
	p=&a;
	printf("%d",p);//when the above statement is commented, then compiler shows an error 
			//because we did not intialized p
}
